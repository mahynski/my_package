PyPI Package Template Instructions
===

1. Choose a name that does not exist in [pypi](https://pypi.org/). You can check by going to https://pypi.org/simple/{my_awesome_new_package}; if you recieve a 404 error the name has not been taken.
2. Replace all "my_package" names, strings, etc. in this repo with your desired package name (e.g., "my_awesome_new_package").  The command below makes this simple; run this after cloning the repo locally.

~~~bash
$ for file in $(find . -type f -not -path "./.git/*"); do sed -i "s/my_package/my_awesome_new_package/g" $file; done
~~~

You should similarly replace all instances of "mahynski" with your GitHub username.

3. Get coding! Follow the instructions below concerning Documentation, etc. for good coding practices.  When you are ready to publish the code, proceed to step 4.
4. Bump the [version](https://semver.org/) appropriately in "my_package/__init__.py" and in the CITATION.cff file.
5. When finished FIRST go to [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and enable preservation of this repo; THEN create a release on GitHub. Zenodo will automatically detect the new release and create a DOI and badge. Update the badge in this `README.md` file and in the `docs/index.rst` file with the new one generated by Zenodo.
6. Finally, follow [these instructions](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) to publish to PyPI.
7. Create a "dev" branch from main on which future development should occur (not main); when future releases are ready they can be merged into the main branch.  This follows a [gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) management model instead of Google's ["live at head"](https://nehckl0.medium.com/googles-live-at-head-approach-and-release-management-4f175b723dae) philosophy.

Best Practices
===

Documentation
---

Documentation is stored in the `docs/` folder and is currently set up to use [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

First create the `requirements.txt` that will be needed to build the documentation. This is done by running `pip-compile` on the `requirements.in` file.

Be sure to add any additional requirements you add to the `pyproject.toml` file etc. to `requirements.in` also.

~~~bash
$ cd docs
$ pip install Sphinx
$ pip install pip-tools
$ pip-compile requirements.in # Modify as needed before executing
~~~

Adjust the `docs/conf.py` as desired. Then run `docs/make_docs.sh` to setup the documentation initially.  You can manually add and adjust later. 

~~~bash
$ bash make_docs.sh
~~~

This command creates documentation for your package, but you still need to adjust the main landing page (`docs/index.rst`) manually.  Here is a [primer](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) on reStructured text markup language.

Go to [https://about.readthedocs.com/](https://about.readthedocs.com/) to link your repo to build and host the documentation automatically!  The `.readthedocs.yml` file contains the configuration for this which you can adjust as needed.

Alternatively, you can start the documentation setup fresh using `sphinx-quickstart` in the `docs/` directory:

~~~bash
$ sphinx-quickstart
~~~

Unittests
---

Build [unittests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) in the `tests/` directory.  The `pyproject.toml` automatically configures pytest to look in `tests/`.  The following will run all unittests in this directory.

~~~bash
$ python -m pytest
~~~

The GitHub workflow in `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` will also run these tests and perform coverage checks using this command.  This workflow is triggered automatically on the main branch, but you can adjust this file so this is automatically triggered on others as well.

Code coverage is configured to work with [codecov.io](https://app.codecov.io/); visit their website to enable this for your new project.  Add your codecov *repository* token (`CODECOV_TOKEN`) to this repo [as a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).  Then update the badge in this `README.md` file and in the `docs/index.rst` file.

Linting
---

Automatic code linting is provided via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/); refer to the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file for the specific configuration which you can adjust as needed.

Run pre-commit to lint new code, then commit the changes.

~~~bash
$ pre-commit run --all-files
~~~

Typing
---

While optional, it is best to include [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) in your code - see [mypy](https://mypy-lang.org/).

~~~bash
$ mypy --ignore-missing-imports my_new_file.py
~~~

Demo
---

Consider building a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) demo to illustrate the capabilities of the tool.  This can be hosted for free in the [community cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).  Refer to their documentation for easy setup, which allows you to put your `app.py` file right here in a public repo, e.g., `streamlit/app.py`.  You may also consider using a [HuggingFace space](https://huggingface.co/spaces) instead.

Logo
---

You can generate a logo or other art using [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) or other AI tools. [Note](https://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=1340355&p=9896961#:~:text=The%20Chicago%20Manual%20of%20Style's,prompt%20that%20generated%20the%20image.) that "the Chicago Manual of Style's website recommends you cite AI-generated images like any other image, while including both the name of the AI tool that generated the image, the company that created the AI, and the prompt that generated the image." Modify the `html_logo` tag in the `docs/conf.py` to point to the logo.

The logo for this repository (`docs/_static/logo.png`) was generated using Google Gemini (Imagen 3) on Nov. 28, 2024 with the prompt "Make a logo inspired by code as a template for python projects."

Citation
---

Update the CITATION.cff, CODEOWNERS, and pyproject.toml files to include all code authors and maintainers appropriately.
